Hello, people of the internet! 

I'm **Rifqi Novandi**.

I am an undergraduate student specializing in information technology with several experiences in data science and predictive modeling using Python. I implemented an end-to-end data science flow and developed machine learning solutions for personal projects and company as well while doing an internship. 

I am passionate about exploring new technology to expand working tools to help me deliver my work as best as it can be. To achieve my goals, I am always eager to learn new things and develop myself professionally. I am currently looking for an internship to demonstrate my ability to solve real-world cases.
